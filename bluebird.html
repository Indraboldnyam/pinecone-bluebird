    <p>Bluebirds are songbirds named for the malesâ€™ bright blue feathers. The soft whistles of their song are among the earliest sounds of spring in North America. Bluebirds belong to the thrush family. This means that they are related to thrushes, robins, and nightingales. There are three species, or types, of bluebird: the eastern bluebird, the western bluebird, and the mountain bluebird.

        Bluebirds are found in fields, orchards, parks, and gardens. Eastern bluebirds live in eastern Canada and the eastern United States. The western and mountain types are found in western Canada and the western United States. Many bluebirds avoid cold winters by flying south for the winter. Some of the birds fly as far south as Mexico.
        
        Most bluebirds are about 7 inches (18 centimeters) long. The males are mostly blue, while the females are mostly bluish gray. The male eastern and western types have rusty-red-colored breasts. The females of those types have dull orange breasts. Bluebirds have slender bills, which they use to eat insects and fruit.
        
        Bluebirds build their nests in holes, such as in trees, fence posts, or nest boxes that people make. The female lays four to six eggs at a time.</p>
